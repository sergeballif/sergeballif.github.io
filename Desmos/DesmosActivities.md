##Number Theory/Algebra
* [Visible Points](https://teacher.desmos.com/activitybuilder/custom/55c2b7f7893085190603468a) - Explore which lattice points have an unimpeded view of the origin. 
* [Die Hard Water Problem](https://teacher.desmos.com/activitybuilder/custom/55bc3cc5adf21bde5ee2266c) - Can you get 4 L from an 8 L container and a 5 L container?

## Algebra
* [Allowable Dating Ages](https://teacher.desmos.com/activitybuilder/custom/55f242b9aec16ef50abcde34) - Use inverse functions and inequalities to explore a mathematical model of appropriate dating ages.
* [Awkward Urinal Situations](https://teacher.desmos.com/activitybuilder/custom/55f1f50c05db543a06e985f1) - Learn about the floor function and ceiling function as you model a men's room that is reaching capacity.
* [Intro to Functions](https://teacher.desmos.com/activitybuilder/custom/5686d3c4e3c4035735f37fb2) - This activity introduces function notation and helps students to learn how to use Desmos to evaluate functions. Students are challenged to create their own functions to model certain situations.
* [Linear Intequalities](https://teacher.desmos.com/activitybuilder/custom/5686e5ca1f871b68550785f4) - Students identify the equation of a linear inequality based off of a graph. Then students create and interpret their own linear inequalities to describe the relationship between variables in a story problem.
* [Exponential and Logarithmic Functions](https://teacher.desmos.com/activitybuilder/custom/5686fa78e3c4035735f38e08) - Students get a bit of practice investigating exponential and logarithmic functions. Mostly the activity focuses on how to use Desmos to explore these functions.
* [A Growing Population](https://teacher.desmos.com/activitybuilder/custom/5688168cf489315635d1f196) - Students compare and contrast linear growth and exponential growth.
 
## Modeling
* [Circle Slicing](https://teacher.desmos.com/activitybuilder/custom/56882081f9151891782e29a8) - Students collect data and find a model for the number of regions that can be obtained by slicing a circle using straight lines. Students learn how to use the curve fitting features of Desmos. Then they get to try slicing another shape and finding a model for the number of regions.
* [Squares in a Grid](https://teacher.desmos.com/activitybuilder/custom/5688a23813626ee577205c73) - Students are challenged to find the number of squares inside a grid pattern. To accomplish this task they collect data and then fit a model to the data. 
* [Laying Cable](https://teacher.desmos.com/activitybuilder/custom/568993a413626ee57720dc7f) - Students are tasked with the problem of laying cable across a parking lot. They have to decide whether to cut across the asphalt (which is more expensive per foot) or to go around. Along the way they create their own models and find the minimum possible cost.
* [The Biggest Pen](https://teacher.desmos.com/activitybuilder/custom/568c1f529d183840060a6ecc) - Students will help Bessy the cow to build her dream pen by finding the dimensions that will maximize the area of the pen. Students will set up a formula for the area of the pen and then use Desmos to find the maximum area.

## Miscellaneous
* [Thinking Mathematically](https://teacher.desmos.com/activitybuilder/custom/5686c4dfe3c4035735f37dda) - This activity introduces some expectations for writing in a math course. Students also get a chance to explain their reasoning on some questions that they might not think of as math problems.
* [Animation](https://teacher.desmos.com/activitybuilder/custom/56889574f489315635d22fb7) - Students are guided to draw a stick man using tables of points. Then they animate the stick man using sliders. Once they have the hang of things they get to create their own animation.

## Geometry
* [Pythagorean Theorem Proof](https://teacher.desmos.com/activitybuilder/custom/5688b71ef489315635d23769) - Students learn the Pythagorean Theorem and find the length of some missing sides. Then they prove the Pythagorean Theorem from scratch by rearranging triangles inside a larger square.
* [Distance Formula](https://teacher.desmos.com/activitybuilder/custom/568ab7fc68912c53074c44a4) - Students review and practice the Pythagorean Theorem. Then they work to discover the distance formula which they get to try out.
* [Area vs Perimeter](https://teacher.desmos.com/activitybuilder/custom/568accae41b5db1f068d44ac) - Students use their Pythagorean Theorem kung fu to find the area and perimeter of several shapes. Then they mix geometry and algebra to find formulas for figures with variable shape.

## Statistics
* [Best Fit Lines](https://teacher.desmos.com/activitybuilder/custom/568c094deb18576d1dda2320) - Students try to eyeball a best fit line to some data points. Then they get to interpret a best fit line to predict some outcomes.
