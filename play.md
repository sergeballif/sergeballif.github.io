## Students need to be teachers.

Turn students into teachers.

## Pocketmod Summary
A pocketmod is a little booklet made out of a single page that has been cut and folded. Teachers can use a pocketmod to create review sheets or worksheets. Students can create their own pocketmod study guides. Imagine the effort students would pour into creating one of these if they were allowed to use their notes on the exam.

The sample below is a pocketmod worksheet that my wife uses to accompany one of her [Science Mom videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsvHQon2IqQ "Science Mom's Guide to Water Part 1").

Below is a review sheet I made as a sample for my students to show them how to create a pocketmod.

Pocketmods can be handwritten. More advanced students can type them up. Feel free to clone [the project here](https://www.overleaf.com/read/mnjkcbfvfjdp) to take advantage of an existing template.

## Topic Resume
Resumes are a great way to introduce get a quick feel for a person. This assignment requires students to create a resume for an idea or a course. It takes a great deal of thought and care to craft a good resume. The example below is a sample resume I created for inverse functions.

I have never actually used this assignment, but I think it would make a good final project. You can clone [the project here](https://www.overleaf.com/read/tjdyzhdtjxws) to use the same template.
