William Steinitz was jubilant. Fortune had smiled upon him this day bringing a much needed influx of cash his way. It was shameful plight for the chess champion of the world to be living in such poverty, but now Steinitz could breath more easily with a full $500 newly deposited into his bank.

It seemed only fair that something would go well for him. The past several years had been difficult financially for him. Â As the thirteenth son of a hardware retailer Steinitz had had to work hard to make his way. Anti-semitic persecution had driven him from his home in England across the Atlantic to New York City. His dignity and reputation had taken a hit in the expulsion, but his chess prowess had proved as formidable as ever. He was proud of his new American citizenship and glad to have distanced himself from critics abroad.

Opportunity had come knocking at his door this morning in the form of thin man in a black suit and vest carrying a leather briefcase. The man wore a nervous grin on his face appropriate to meeting a celebrity of Steinitz's stature. He introduced himself with a firm handshake as Mr. Golding, an ardent fan and admirer. He had come as a representative of a wealthy businessman who was interested in playing a game with the World Champion. Of course Steinitz was honored by the request, but he politely declined the invitation stating that with the upcoming world championship match only four months away his focus needed to be on preparation. Perhaps a friendly game could be arranged at a later date.

Golding's smile had not wavered at the rejection. Rather, it grew wider as he announced that his employer was willing to pay generously for the honor of playing a game with the esteemed champion. At this announcement Steinitz was all ears, for both his pocketbook and ego were susceptible to flattery. The paltry earnings from his chess column were hardly enough to live on, let alone up to the standard that a world champion deserved. Everyone wanted to play against the best, but nobody wanted to compensate him for it. 

Golding had then extracted a contract from his fancy briefcase. The single page document was typeset on a crisp but plain piece of paper using an elegant font that Steinitz had never seen before. A cursory glance at the document revealed the detail that would make or break the deal as far as Steinitz was concerned---the payment, $500, to be paid in advance, for a single game. 

What kind of a hoax was this? Before Steinitz could raise any objections Golding flipped the contract to the back of the page and pointed out another sweetener, an additional $100 to Steinitz if he proved victorious. Steinitz had bristled momentarily at the insinuation that he could lose such a contest with an amateur, but before any indignant words had reached his mouth he spotted the key phrase "_played under conditions of pawn and move odds_". Oh, very well then. A gift of a pawn might serve to balance things out if his challenger was a suitably strong player, though few players were at such a level to make Steinitz break a sweat, even at the gift of a full piece, let alone a pawn. 

Of course none of this had mattered as the whole thing was a hoax. The deal was simply too good to be true. Nobody could toss money around in this fashion. Steinitz had recently finished months of fundraising himself to satisfy the winning purse of $2000 for his upcoming match with Lasker. Money did not get tossed around like this. 

As Steinitz began to raise his newest objection, Golding's smile increased to the point that his teeth were showing. He reached into his briefcase and pulled out  a wad of bills held together by a rubber band and handed them to Steinitz. Steinitz had stood speechless examining the bills for a full dozen seconds before clearing his throat and uttering the words "When shall we play?"

"The game must take place today to accommodate Mr. Deos's schedule" replied Golding. "You'll find all the details in the contract. We can proceed in 30 minutes if you are in agreement."

"I am very intrigued to meet this Mr. Deos."

At this remark from Steinitz, Golding's smile had faltered for the first time. "Actually, Mr. Deos is a man who is not comfortable around others. Especially around people of great celebrity. His weak constitution and general anxiety make such interactions intolerable. In fact, this is the reason that I was contracted to act on Mr. Deos's behalf in the matter of this chess game." 

"But how are we to play a correspondence game in the course of a single day?"

Golding's smile returned, "I shall be the intermediary, playing the role of courier so that moves can be shared without delay. You'll find all the details in the contract. If you are amenable to proceeding you can sign the document and play can commence when you are ready." 

A few moments later Steinitz had found himself alone in his apartment standing in a stunned daze, the newly signed contract in his right hand and a wad of cash in his left. Again suspicion crept to his mind. What kind of a scam could be underway when Steinitz himself had nothing to lose? He could find no plausible way that this situation could end badly as long as the money was genuine. If this was a con then for now he would gladly play along.

A quick trip to the bank had removed all doubt from Steinitz. The money was real, and it was his to keep. Now all that remained was the game. A single, simple game that would likely take all day to finish with its strange correspondence format. Steinitz's time was important to him, but there was no point in complaining in this instance where he was being so handsomely compensated.

Golding returned at the specified time, his jovial smile leading the way. It warmed Steinitz's heart to see Golding so excited and nervous. It was endearing to see the way that a grown man could be so timid around his hero.

"The board is set up and awaiting the first move," announced Steinitz.

"Excellent!" replied Golding. "This is truly an honor."

"Thank you. Please let us get started. Does Mr. Deos have a particular pawn in mind that I am to forego or has he left that choice to me?" Steinitz was genuinely looking forward to this game. He had been paid as a chess tutor on a few occasions before, but this lesson would be by far his most lucrative.

Golding opened his mouth to reply, but hesitated, the words catching in his throat. Finally he spoke, his voice apprehensive, "Did you not read the contract Mr. Steinitz? It is not you who will give the pawn and move odds, but rather Mr. Deos. You are to play the white side after choosing a black pawn to remove from the board for your opponent." 

Steinitz went cold with shock as the words settled in though it took only a moment for the heat to return. His legendary temper rose within him and his voice followed suit. 

"This an outrage! I don't invite guests into my home to insult me." Steinitz was pleased to see Golding wilt under his displeased gaze, his usual smile replaced by wide open eyes. At a height of only 5' 1" Steinitz could still be as intimidating as any man.

Abruptly Steinitz's smile returned and he began to laugh. "You're teasing me. A capital joke."

Golding did not return the smile. He opened his mouth to speak and raised his index finger, but no words made their way to his lips. Impatiently Steinitz retrieved the contract from the table and scanned the relevant paragraph. Unbelievable! The terms of their game were spelled out in exact detail just as Golding had described. 

Steinitz turned on Golding and declared in a scathing voice. "There will be no mockery of a game Mr. Golding." Steinitz glared at Golding, daring him to contradict him.

Somewhat taken aback Golding replied. "Very well Mr. Steinitz. The contract does have a clear provision allowing you to cancel the game before it commences. If you will return the money I shall be on my way."

Now it was Steinitz's turn to be speechless. What was he thinking? $600 was at stake. It was unimaginable to part with such a sum of money, regardless of how newly acquired it was. Besides, Steinitz was embarrassed to admit that he had so hastily deposited the cash at the bank. Very well, a little diplomacy was called for.  After a deep inhalation Steinitz spoke with composure. 

"Mr. Golding, I find the current arrangement unsatisfactory. No odds need to be given in a game between gentlemen. Let us play the game with all our pawns, and I shall be glad to accept the white pieces." Ah yes, in any negotiation you must give a little and take a little.

"I'm sorry Mr. Steinitz, but my instructions are explicit in this matter. The contract must be followed to the letter or the payment must be revoked." Golding was polite but firm as he spoke.

Of all the insufferable indignities. Steinitz was used to detractors and critics. He had always been able to defend his honor at the chessboard up until this point, punishing those who chose to show him disdain. Yet under the terms of this game there would be no honor in victory. Very well, perhaps he would have to find satisfaction in earning $600 for a single chess game. Come to think of it, the money would more than compensate for his bruised ego. He would laugh all the way to the bank with his winnings. Of course he might also have to punish Mr. Deos by keeping the game short. 

"So be it," said Steinitz. As he marched to the board he saw Golding breath a sigh of relief. Could it be that Deos had found a line that gave black an advantage when starting without a pawn? After all, the problemist Loyd had recently demonstrated that a side with all 8 pawns removed had an easy win because the more powerful pieces could attack almost immediately. Just to be safe, the usual odds of the f7 pawn would not be proffered today. Take that you silly contract! Steinitz reached down and plucked a black pawn from the board.  

"Please tell Mr. Deos that he will be playing without his c7 pawn." Steinitz sat the pawn aside with rather more force than was necessary.  "I assume that you are familiar with algebraic notation for chess."

"Indeed sir," said Golding, inclining his head as he resumed his ingratiating smile. He took the seat across from Steinitz without waiting for an invitation. Steinitz stared at the board for only a moment before advancing a pawn 1.e4. 

Golding dutifully recorded the move and stood to leave. "I shall return shortly with a reply move from Mr. Deos. I thank you on his behalf for doing us the honor of playing this game."

With that remark Golding bowed himself out the front door and into the street. Steinitz sat at his table flummoxed. What a peculiar situation he had found himself in. He did not like the unpleasant surprises the contract had provided, but it had been his own fault. His eagerness to receive the money and verify its authenticity had prevented him from finding time to read the finer details. Well there would be no more surprises from this contract. 

Steinitz retrieved the document and sat reading it quietly. In spite of his annoyance he found himself impressed. With minimal legalese the contract had spelled out the details just as Golding had explained them. One notable clause stipulated that no player could spend more than ten minutes on any move once they had received their opponents move. This detail anticipated the problem that could arise if the game were to move too slowy. Steinitz was offended to read that the game must be played to conclusion; resignation would not be allowed until at least move 50. Certainly Deos wanted to get his money's worth out of the game, but it was an insult to think Steinitz could find himself in a position to resign.

Everything seemed to be aboveboard other than the silly pawn and move odds that had been so annoying. The signature at the bottom directly above Steinitz's own read Gabriel O. Deos in flowing cursive letters. Steinitz did not know what kind of a business Deos ran or how successful he was, but if the fine quality of the stationery had not been enough to tip Steinitz off as too Deos's wealth, then the $600 prize money would surely have done the trick.

A knock at the door announced Golding's return. Excellent. Barely five minutes had elapsed. If Deos was staying in such close proximity then the game would proceed at an acceptable pace. Steinitz welcomed the ever smiling Golding back into his home, and Golding walked immediately to the board and seated himself as he made a move 1. .. Qa4. Steinitz held back a smile; an early queen move was usually a sign of an optimistic, but weak player. Solid development was the key to success at the chessboard. Steinitz had single-handedly brought an end to the so called "Romantic Era" of chess with his principled style of play. Some had derided his technique, calling it boring, but it was easy to recognize the criticism as sour grapes from those who had recently tasted defeat at his hands. 

Steinitz was glad that Golding had sat at the table instead of just relaying the move vocally. Golding provided a face for his opponent. Steinitz wondered whether Golding's smile would continue the same throughout the whole game regardless of the state of his pieces. Steinitz developed his queen knight (2.Nc3). With a nod of his head Golding stood and let himself out. 

Steinitz was relieved to see that Golding knew at the least the basics of chess. Steinitz had feared that he would have to endure a long day of listening to a messenger refer to "the horsey" or "the castle" instead of the pieces' proper names. Golding's silence at the board was also good etiquette which spoke well of him and the game to come. Of course Steinitz would still punish Deos for his impudence, but he could do so without malice and even while enjoying himself.

Steinitz knew the early game so well that there was little thinking required at this stage. An idea occurred to him. Perhaps this game could be written up for his chess column. He might need to tweak the details of the setting, but such a game might prove amusing to his reader. He pulled out a sheet of paper and recorded the first moves. 

Golding soon returned and the game continued in its slow but steady fashion as the remaining knights were developed (2. ..Â Nf6 3.Nf3 Nc6). By the time Steinitz had brought out his bishop and castled (4.Bc4 e6 5.O-O) he was pleased to have such a solid, textbook worthy position.  At the first sign of aggression two pawns were traded off (5. .. d5 6.exd5 exd5). Steinitz grudgingly admitted to himself that Deos's play had thus far been beyond reproach. Perhaps the man would put up some resistance after all. Of course it was much too early in the game to make predictions now. The usual path to victory was to play a solid game while waiting for the opponent to make the first blunder. It was not a question of if such a blunder would take place, but rather when it would occur. While Steinitz waited between moves he puttered about his apartment taking a bite to eat. He also dutifully recorded the moves while adding instructive annotations to the moves.

![board after move 6]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Move6.jpg)

After 7.Bb5 Bd6 8.Re1+ Be6 9.Ng5 Steinitz wrote _The two pinned pieces are an annoyance that black will soon regret._ 

![board after move 8]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Move8.jpg)

After 9. .. O-O 10.Nxe6 fxe6 11.Rxe6 Steinitz wrote _Not only is black down two pawns, but he will now play the rest of the game without the bishop pair._ Perhaps he would add to this annotation later to chide white for his own lack of pawn development.

![board on move 11]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Move11.jpg)

A surprise came on move 11 as Deos started an attack, sacrificing a bishop for a pawn (11. .. Bxh2+). For the first time Steinitz truly studied the board. He had made each of his preceding moves in less than 30 seconds, in part because the early moves were easy, he knew the openings forwards and backwards. However the quick pace also served to reinforce the message to Deos (hopefully relayed by Golding) that Steinitz was breezing through the game. Steinitz did not want to give Deos the satisfaction of having flustered Steinitz in any way. 

After a couple of minutes Steinitz concluded that the sacrifice might possibly be sound as it offered some immediate counter-play that would cause Steinitz to return the material. Yet there was nothing to do except to accept the sacrifice of the optimistic bishop and expose his king (12.Kxh2). Steinitz had started up a pawn, and for the moment he was up a minor piece and a pawn.

Deos replied by moving his knight to the center in an elegant move that forked both knight and bishop (12. .. Nd4). Steinitz retreated the rook back a square (13.Re5). He lamented the loss of the bishop pair that would come on the next turn as he was fond of wreaking havoc with the powerful duo. Once again he was impressed with Deos's game.  

![board on move 13]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Move13.jpg)

Yet the expected capture did not occur on the next move. Instead Deos abandoned his double attack on Steinitz's knight and retreated his queen to the diagonal of Steinitz's king (13. .. Qc7). It was now Steinitz's turn to deal with a pin as his rook could not move. Yet a simple pawn move removed the annoying pin and protected the rook from the attacking queen (14.f4). Black lacked both bishops and a pawn, while Steinitz was missing only a knight. 

Next Deos captured the white bishop as Steinitz had incorrectly predicted on the previous move. (14. .. Nxb5). Steinitz saw black's clever tactic, though again there was little to do. Without the queen's support Steinitz recaptured black's knight to go up a bishop and a pawn (15.Nxb5). However Deos brought his queen in with a double threat (15. .. Qc4). 

![board after move 15]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Move15.jpg)

Steinitz would need to give up the knight to avoid a fork of his king and rook. Steinitz developed a pawn before watching his knight disappear from the board (16.d4 Qxb5). It was time to protect his king (17.Kg1). 

![board on move 17]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Move17.jpg)

Steinitz had been so caught up in the game that he had neglected to annotate any of the recent moves. He could always go back at a later date and add in the commentary, though he took a moment to jot down a line or two.

_Note that white is still up a pawn, though black has some compensation in a better protected king._

Steinitz found himself annoyed that he had been unable to press his initial advantage. Deos had proved to be a much stronger opponent than Steinitz had expected. Indeed, Steinitz felt strangely as though he were playing himself. 

As the game continued into the afternoon there was no delay to Golding's arrivals. Why did the man keep smiling? Upon noting the consistent timing, Steinitz had watched the clock more carefully.  The duration from the time that Steinitz's door had closed to the return knock announcing Golding's return had been exactly 5 minutes and 8 seconds for each of the last three moves. Curious indeed. Even if Golding could make the trip to and from Deos's location in just a minute's time, then Deos was spending at most three minutes considering each new move. 

The game proceeded 17. .. Qc6 18.Qe2 Rae8 19.Be3 h5 20.Qd3 Ng4. 

![board after move 20]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Move21.jpg)

Perhaps it was time to simplify by trading off rooks (21.Rxe8 Rxe8 22.Bd2 Qb6. 23.b3 Re4 24.c3 Qe6 25.Qg3). 

![board on move 25]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Move25.jpg)

Golding continued to arrive at regular time intervals, the time of his arrival never varied by more than 10 seconds. Surely this must be intentional. Though Steinitz was still up a pawn he sensed that something was wrong. His advantage had evaporated. He liked black's position as much as his own. The most frustrating part was that he had made no blunders. In fact he could not point to a single inaccuracy in his own play. After three hours of play Steinitz was further from winning than ever. Clearly his opponent was no amateur.

But what then could be the purpose for the strange terms of the game? Steinitz pondered the possibilities, and he could only come up with a single motive. Embarrassment. Someone was trying to embarrass Steinitz. Yet, who could possibly hope to play a game against the world champion and come out on top, especially when giving pawn and move odds? Who would bet $600 on a slim chance of embarrassing Steinitz?

The list of possible perpetrators was not long. Zukertort was the obvious suspect. Their long mutual animosity was well documented, and Zukertort no doubt longed for revenge for his defeat by Steinitz in their world championship match. Blackburne was another possibility, though Steinitz doubted that Blackburne had it in him to bring a challenge after the drubbing he had received at Steinitz's hands. Chigorin was on friendly terms with Steinitz, or at least he thought so. 

Could it be Lasker? That upstart was entirely too full of himself. Their world championship match was only 4 months away. Steinitz had agreed to lower the prize money for their upcoming match because Lasker had been unable to secure the funds. If he had $600 to spare, then it certainly shouldn't be used on a frivolous attempt to embarass Steinitz. Perhaps the idea was to undermine his confidence before their match. Regardless, there was only one way to parry the threat of this attack; it was time to crush Deos.

With fewer pieces on the board the game would now come down to who could calculate the best. Soon Golding returned with that stupid grin on his face. No doubt he was in on this sham game. Moves followed. If anything the pace accelerated, which was fine with Steinitz. After all Deos was losing time to think each move due to the delay when Golding was traveling. 

Steinitz managed to trade off the remaining rooks (25. .. Re2 26.Re1 Kf7 27.Qh4 Rxe1+ 28.Qxe1). Yet his frustration grew.  Steinitz's initiative was shrinking with each move. It didn't matter if he was up a pawn if that pawn gave no advantage. It might be time to play the game away from the chessboard. If a trap was laid for Steinitz, then perhaps he should set it off early. For the last several moves Steinitz had watched Golding's path as he arrived for his turn and as he retreated to relay Steinitz's move. Each time Golding appeared out of a nearby alleyway walking purposefully with his long strides. Each time Deos's inevitable blunder refused to appear.  Steinitz made up his mind that after the next move he would follow Golding.

Golding returned and moved his queen to avoid an exchange of the queens. Steinitz replied almost immediately with an innocent shuffle of his bishop (28. .. Qf5 29.Bc1). He smiled, inclining his head in a nod to Golding as Golding stood with his smug face and exited. 

![board on move 29]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Move29.jpg)

Steinitz was neither stealthy nor inconspicuous, and he knew it well. He was still unsure where or who his adversary was, so it was important to him not to play his hand too quickly. He would follow Golding on this move to see where Golding went after the alley. Steinitz could follow again after the next turn to trace the next leg of the journey if needed. If he proceeded carefully by degree to follow Golding then perhaps he could find the location and identity of the mysterious Mr. Deos without revealing that he was on to him. Steinitz pictured the scene in his mind of confronting his adversary about his duplicity. Could it be that several chess players had collaborated together to play against him? That might explain the lack of blunders and overall quality of play. It was just the type of thing Zukertort would do.

Steinitz peeked into the alley ready to rush around the corner. A dark shape blocked his view, and he stopped his momentum just in time as he realized it was a man. Steinitz quickly withdrew his head as he recognized the briefcase at the man's feet. It was Golding standing with his back to the wall. 

Steinitz's heart raced in his chest. What was Golding doing? Shouldn't he be traveling to meet Deos to convey the next move? Is this what Golding did for every move? Would Deos come to meet Golding? Perhaps there was no Mr. Deos and Golding was Steinitz's real opponent.There was certainly no chessboard in sight. Steinitz sneaked another glance. Golding rested idly, his arms folded in a relaxed manner. He seemed to be waiting for something. 

Confusion washed over Steinitz. What was going on? Unsure how much time had passed, Steinitz hustled back to his apartment, trying to make no sound with each step. For some reason he was apprehensive of getting caught. Steinitz tried to catch his breath as his mind raced. He was getting too old for this type of stress. It made no sense. The odd contract, the faceless opponent. Steinitz could not wrap his head around it. Most puzzling of all was that Steinitz was not winning the game. 

Steinitz jumped at a knock on the door announced Golding's return. Steinitz could feel his heart beating in his ears. He tried to collect his composure as he let Mr. Golding in. As Golding sat at the table Steinitz ignored the board, instead studying Golding's face. Steinitz had never seen such white teeth in his life. They were perfectly straight and aligned.

Golding sensed Steinitz's scrutiny, and he lifted his eyes to meet Steinitz's gaze. Steinitz hastily looked away, turning his focus to black's last move (29. .. b5). Intriguing--- a pawn advance. Could Steinitz take advantage of his pawn majority on the queen side? Steinitz offered a trade of pawns (30.a4).

He breathed a sigh of relief at Golding's departure. He wasn't sure of the consequences if he had been caught, but somehow spying on an opponent seemed undignified for a world champion. What was happening with Golding in that alley? If a meeting with Deos had taken place, then it had been very short indeed. There was a mystery here that warranted investigation. Yet Steinitz hesitated to venture outside again. Perhaps in a few moves he might try again. 

The game continued (30. .. bxa4 31.bxa4).

![board on move 31]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Move31.jpg)

Upon returning Golding broke his pattern of silent observation for the first time. After making black's move (31. .. Nf6) he politely addressed Steinitz. "Mr. Steinitz. Might I use your bathroom while you ponder your move?" 

"Certainly," replied Steinitz pointing to the room off of his parlor. 

Golding excused himself. Steinitz studied the board, digging his knuckles into the wood of his table. He glanced at the vacant chair, and his eyes grew wide as he saw that Golding had left his briefcase sitting unattended. Could there be some clues to this mystery hidden inside the case? Steinitz didn't know how long he had until Golding returned, so he made the decision to act. He rounded the table and carefully undid the clasps. Steinitz opened the lid a couple of inches and peered inside. All that he found was small rectangular block with a smooth black surface. Puzzled, Steinitz picked it up to exam it. 

Steinitz was startled to hear the toilet flush. Alarmed, he tossed the block back into the briefcase rather harder than he had intended and closed the briefcase. He quickly locked the clasps and moved to dash back to his seat before Golding could see him. Yet before he had returned to his seat he heard a low voice speaking.

_... remains intact, and you appear to have gone undetected._

Who was speaking? The voice seemed to be so close. Steinitz searched the room with his eyes for the source of the voice, but there was nobody in sight. He could hear Golding approaching from behind.

_We have verified that electronic communication can be sent over an extended interval and shared in both directions._

Golding ignored the voice and went straight for his briefcase which he opened. Did he know what Steinitz had just done? Steinitz still couldn't identify the source of the voice, though it might have grown louder. His phonograph sat unmoving upon a side table. 

_Please signal for immediate extraction upon completion of the game. Congratulations._

Steinitz trotted to his telephone, but before he arrived the voice went silent. Steinitz turned back to Golding who looked up after closing his briefcase? Did his smile look guilty this time? When Golding said nothing Steinitz broke the silence. "Did you hear that voice just now?"

"Indeed," said Golding, nodding. "I assumed that you were engaged in a telephone call."

"Not at all," snapped Steinitz. "Surely you saw that I wasn't near my telephone." Something fishy was surely afoot. 

"I'm sorry," replied Golding contritely. "I ignored your conversation in an attempt to give you some privacy. I thought I had heard the telephone ring."

Steinitz paused. Was it possible that the telephone had rung? Could he have missed such a sound? He had been engaging in some subterfuge at the time and could have been distracted. Perhaps if he pressed the matter Golding would inquire about why his briefcase had been moved while he was away from the table.

Golding's eyes had returned to the board where he noted that Steinitz had not yet made his move. He looked up and met Steinitz's gaze expectantly as though inviting him back to the board. Steinitz sat down heavily upon his chair.

Golding returned and retreated his knight. Steinitz replied almost immediately with an innocent shuffle of is queen (32.Qe2).   

![board on move 32]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Move32.jpg)

Golding's queen continued to harass Steinitz (32. .. Qb1). Perhaps a trade of queens could be cajoled? Steinitz made his move (33.Qb2) though he regretted it as soon as Golding stood up to leave. Steinitz couldn't afford to play while flustered.

![board on move 33]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Move33.jpg)

The game proceeded, and more pieces were juggled. Deos succeeded in planting his knight on a key central square (33. .. Qd3 34.Bd2 Qe2 35.Qc1 Ne4 36.Be1). His refusal to err was grating. Steinitz was troubled with the idea of settling for a draw in a game with odds in his favor, but he had to admit that the game was not going well.

![board on move 36]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Move36.jpg)

Steinitz was tempted to return again to spy on Golding, but for now he turned his attention to the contract. Could he learn more about this mysterious Mr. Deos? Steinitz racked his brain trying to recall if he had ever encountered the name Gabriel O. Deos, but no recollection came to mind. As he stared at the signature his breath caught in his throat. The flowing, cursive, capital letters at the  beginning of each name stood out: G.O.D. The initials were written in large letters while the letters that followed seemed intentionally small as if to minimize their existence.

Only then did Steinitz recall a boast he had made over a decade earlier after his defeat of Blackburne 7-0. "God himself couldn't give me pawn and move odds." The comment was not made publicly, but under his breath in a self-congratulatory manner. Just a pat on the back. There was no way that anyone could know of it.

Could this be part of the prank? Could Deos be trying to intimidate Steinitz not only with his god-like play, but also by pretending to be God? Wait! "Deos" was the Spanish word for God. How had Steinitz missed that detail?

Steinitz crept to the alleyway entrance with more trepidation than on his previous pursuit attempt. He couldn't be sure that Golding would be in the same spot, but somehow he knew what he would find. Sure enough he could see Golding around the corner. He was fiddling with something inside his briefcase. Steinitz pulled back, not wanting to be discovered.

Suddenly Golding Spoke, "What do you think?"

Steinitz's heart dropped, and he stifled a groan. He'd been discovered. He moved to step out to confront Golding, but Golding spoke on. "If Stockfish says -1.22 centipawns, then I'm not worried."

Steinitz stopped. Whom was Golding addressing? He was alone in the alley. No voice responded, and Golding said no more. Had Steinitz been spotted or not? Steinitz slowly tucked and hurried back to his apartment.

Now Steinitz was more confused than before. What or who was stockfish? What was a centi-pawn? Had he heard incorrectly?

There was little time to process these questions before Golding returned.

Black's queen was harrassing white's king. Black's king advanced. Steinitz could find no opportunity for counter-attack (36. .. Ke6 37.a5 Kf5 38.a6 Kg4). He felt as though he were inside a vice, relentless, unforgiving pressure closing in on all sides. Was his play weaker because of his confusion at the game's circumstances, or was he just being outplayed?

He wanted to scream in frustration. He pulled at his beard in dissatisfaction. There was no denying the deficit of his position. Unless Golding, or rather, Deos (God?) made a blunder Steinitz would lose this game. Could he bring himself to resign? Steinitz looked at his move list and realized to his horror that the game had not yet reached move 50. Curse that ridiculous contract. Why had he agreed to such a game? Could Steinitz hope for God to make a blunder? Would it be impious to pray to God asking him to make a mistake?

Steinitz returned his extra pawn and tried a flanking maneuver with his bishop (39.c4 dxc4 40.Ba5).

Yet black casually chased his queen into a corner and advanced a pawn (40. .. Qf2+ 41.Kh2 c3).

Finally Steinitz could go on the attack. He checked black's king with his queen and then his bishop (42.Qd1+ Kxf4 43.Bc7+ Kg5).

Yet black ignored Steinitz's threats and advanced his pawn to the second rank, one step away from promoting to another queen (44.d5 c2). Steinitz needed to gain only a single tempo to retake control yet black was unwilling to fall for his traps (45.Qa1 Kg6 46.Qc1 Kf5 47. Bb8 Qd2).

Rather than capitulate by trading off queens, Steinitz went on the attack, though he saw that he would soon be facing two queens (48.Qf1+ Kg5 49.Qf7).

If black promoted his pawn to a second queen too early then Steinitz saw that he would obtain a perpetual check. No luck (Nf6 50.Qxg7+ Kf5).

Steinitz could not believe it. He had been defeated. He played on a few moves to make sure that he didn't resign at the first available opportunity. He hoped against hope that his fortunes might change, but he knew no blunder would be forthcoming. (51.Be5 Kxe5 52.Qc7+ Kf5 53.Qc8+ Kg5 54.Qc7 c1=Q 55.Qg7+ Kf5 56.Qg3 Ng4+).

Steinitz had been unable to make himself meet Golding's eyes for the last several moves, but he forced himself to look at Golding as he offered his silent resignation. He expected to see smugness in Golding's face, but his smile was a genuine now as it had been upon their introduction over six hours earlier. 

"Thank you for the honor of this game," said Golding with no hint of gloating or malice. He stood to leave, an action that surprised Steinitz. Surely there was something left to be said. Some explanation. A threat or a jibe. Who had Steinitz been playing this whole game? He needed answers. 

As Golding closed the front door behind him Steinitz snapped out of his shock. He stood and walked to the door determined to get some information. He stepped out his door and opened his mouth to call to Golding, but the street was empty. How? Where could he have gone in such a short time. Steinitz quickly checked the alleyway but found it empty. He walked back home shaking his head, thoroughly confounded. 

When he got back inside his apartment he walked to his chessboard and examined the final position. He examined his feelings. Of course he had lost games before, but never had he felt so utterly defeated. In his other losses he could always identify what had gone wrong. This game had been different. He wasn't sure if he even believed in God, but this game had him questioning that position. 

He glanced at his notepad next to the board where he had been making his annotations. The pad had been turned over to hide the writing from Golding. Steinitz had stopped making annotations once the game had turned South. Steinitz tore the page from the notebook and crumpled it before tossing it in the fire. He wasn't sure what to make of his experience this day, but he was positive that he would not be sharing it with others. 

---------------------------

Postscript: Four months later Steinitz lost his World Championship match with Lasker.  He never regained his form, though he continued to play solid chess. He died seven years later in an asylum after a mental breakdown. Stories say that he was convinced that he was playing a game of chess against God over an invisible telephone wire.
