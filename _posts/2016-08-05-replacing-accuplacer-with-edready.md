At the beginning of the summer I wrote a post [Revamping College Math Placement](https://sergeballif.github.io/math/teaching/revamping-college-math-placement) about our new placement exam policy at NSC. This post is a follow up report to share our progress.

Previously we had been using the Accuplacer test to place all students in their initial math course.  The new placement scheme uses an ACT score (a new requirement for all high school graduates in Nevada) to make an initial placement. Then students can complete work in EdReady over the summer to improve their placement into a college level math course.

The new placement policy puts the ball in a student's court. Fortunately students have responded well.

## The Numbers

For Fall 2016 we had $n$ students who placed into remedial math for fall semester. We contacted these students about EdReady through various channels: phone calls from a student worker, emails with the specific details, and new student orientation. At the end of summer semester we have $113$ students who have improved their placement. Of those $113$ students $48$ will place into a stretch version of their college level course that has an additional remedial component. The remaining $65$ students worked further through EdReady to place into just a college level course.

## Risks and Rewards
Historical trends suggest that more than 70% of our students place into remedial level math. Students who ignore EdReady will just keep their initial placement. There is no disadvantage to students who choose not to use EdReady. 

Our old system using Accuplacer had a poor track record of placing students in the right level. High school GPA has proved to be a more reliable indicator of success. Unsurprisingly a single test taken in the middle of the summer is worse at reflecting a student's potential than the accumulated data of several years of effort offered by a GPA member. 

The new system isn't without risks. Couldn't a weak student slip through to a more advanced class than they would qualify for? Possibly, but if a student wants to shoot themselves in the foot, then they will probably find a way to do it anyway. Will EdReady truly provide all the learning that a full semester-long course would? For diligent students, the answer is probably "yes". If you show me a student who takes the initiative to spend 20 to 30 hours over the summer studying math on their own, working through problems, consistently bringing up their score, and I'll show you a student who will thrive in a college level math course. Only time will tell if these students will actually succeed.
