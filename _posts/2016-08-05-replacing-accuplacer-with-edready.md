At the beginning of the summer I wrote a post [Revamping College Math Placement](https://sergeballif.github.io/math/teaching/revamping-college-math-placement) about our new placement exam policy. Previously we had been using the Accuplacer test to place all students in their initial math course.  The new placement scheme uses an ACT score (a new requirement for all high school graduates in Nevada) to make an initial placement. We expect to have roughly 70% of our students place into remedial level math just as in the past. However our new policy lets students complete work in EdReady over the summer to improve their placement into a college level math course.

Students who ignore EdReady will just keep their initial placement.
