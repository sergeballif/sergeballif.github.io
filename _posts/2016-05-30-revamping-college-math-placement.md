Getting students placed in the right math class in college is a challenge that plagues all of higher ed. Math is often the obstacle that keeps students from progressing to a degree, especially when they place below the level of a college math course. This problem is all too common; about 75% of our incoming students at Nevada State College place into remedial math based. 

Often the initial course placement is just wrong. Occasionally a student will end up in a math course that is too advanced for them, but the more common problem is to have a student taking a course that is too easy for them. The Accuplacer placement test has proved to be a poor predictor of success. It turns out that high school GPA would be a much better indicator of the correct placement. In hindsight, it seems obvious that a long term measure of diligence (like GPA) would be a better tool for deciding the right level to start college than a single test taken in the middle of the summer.

This year we are changing our approach. The goal is to remove all of the bottlenecks and give students at least one successful math experience in their lives.

What is EdReady?
================

[]

[][1]

EdReady is a free learning platform that motivated students can use to
fill in the gaps in their math knowledge. EdReady contains videos and
learning materials to help you learn the content that you would normally
learn by taking Math 95M at NSC.

Students who would like to improve their placement from the Accuplacer
test can work through EdReady to place into a higher class. (In the long
run we would like to phase out the Accuplacer test altogether and
replace it with EdReady.)

Why EdReady?
============

It saves you time and money. **EdReady is free**. Math 095M costs more
than $800 and takes a whole semester. Any student who is sufficiently
motivated to work through the EdReady material without needing a teacher
to prod them to action can succeed with EdReady.

How do I get started?
=====================

First determine whether you plan to continue on to Calculus. Go to
[nsc.edready.org] and follow the instructions to create an account.
Enter the key **`placement`** (or **`placementcalculustrack`** for
students who plan to take calculus eventually) and click submit. Then
click Get Started!

Each time you log in you will work on the goal “Accuplacer
Prep-Elementary Algebra” (or “Accuplacer Prep - College Level Math” for
students on the calculus track). Select that goal and click Go to Goal.
Click on Start assessment to take your initial test to see what you need
to work on.

Over time you can view your progress as your score rises.

How will my EdReady score affect my placement?
==============================================

You must first take the Accuplacer test to get an initial placement if
you have not taken the ACT or SAT. Then you can work through EdReady to
improve your placement. Everything must be completed manually at this
time, so you will need to contact LaKiasha Hollingsworth at
[LaKiasha.Hollingsworth@nsc.edu] so that she can verify your progress
and place you in a class. At the time of your email, you must provide
your NSHE ID and the Course Section for the math class you would like to
enroll in. Please note that we will only place students in a course if
they have taken a placement exam (such as Accuplacer, ACT, or SAT). This
policy may change in the future, but for now we need data.
