## Pocketmod Summary
A pocketmod is a little booklet made out of a single page that has been cut and folded. Teachers can use a pocketmod to create review sheets or worksheets. Students can create their own pocketmod study guides. 

The sample below is a pocketmod worksheet that my wife uses to accompany one of her [Science Mom videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsvHQon2IqQ "Science Mom's Guide to Water Part 1").
